# **User Behavior Dataset for K-Means Clustering**

**Data Description:**

This dataset contains information about user behavior on a specific application. It's designed for K-Means clustering analysis to identify distinct user segments based on their engagement patterns.

**Columns:**

1. **userid:** Unique identifier for each user.
2. **Average Screen Time:** Average time spent on the app per session (in minutes).
3. **Average Spent on App (INR):** Average amount spent on the app per session (in Indian Rupees).
4. **Left Review:** Binary indicator (1/0) indicating whether the user has left a review.
5. **Ratings:** Average rating given by the user to the app.
6. **New Password Request:** Binary indicator (1/0) indicating whether the user has requested a new password.
7. **Last Visited Minutes:** Number of minutes since the user's last visit to the app.
8. **Status:** Current status of the user's account (e.g., active, inactive, deleted).

**Potential Use Cases for K-Means Clustering:**

* **User Segmentation:** Identify distinct groups of users based on their behavior and engagement patterns.
* **Personalized Recommendations:** Tailor recommendations and marketing campaigns to specific user segments.
* **Churn Prediction:** Predict which users are likely to churn based on their behavior.
* **Product Improvement:** Identify areas for improvement in the app based on user feedback and usage patterns.

**K-Means Clustering:**

1. **Determine the Optimal Number of Clusters:** Use techniques like the elbow method or silhouette analysis to identify the optimal number of clusters.
2. **Initialize Cluster Centers:** Randomly select initial cluster centers.
3. **Assign Data Points to Clusters:** Assign each data point to the nearest cluster center based on a distance metric (e.g., Euclidean distance).
4. **Update Cluster Centers:** Recalculate the cluster centers as the mean of all data points assigned to that cluster.
5. **Iterate:** Repeat steps 3 and 4 until convergence (i.e., cluster assignments no longer change significantly).
